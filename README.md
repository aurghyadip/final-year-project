# General Project Information
---

### Applications being used when developing this project
1. Dropbox Paper. For sharing ideas and collaborative editing.
2. GitHub, for sharing and collaborating code.
3. A text/code editor (Atom/Sublime/VIM)
4. Overleaf for preparing SRS using $$\LaTeX$$.


### What we are doing!
- **Collaborative** and **non-destructive** document editing.
-  We have implemented highly online based collaborative systems such as Dropbox paper or Google Docs where **simultaneous editing and commenting** is supported. That way we don't have to mail files back and forth and this is highly time saving
- Modular coding, actually this is the reason we are using Git. So that everyone gets synchronized and be updated on the progress of everyone.
- Overleaf is a highly collaborative team based document preparation platform where the topics can be divided into modules. And no single module is dependent on another module. So, that way we can prepare the SRS collaboratively and simultaneously without depending on another team member to send files. Plus merging is automatic, we don't have to rewrite the whole ToC if a section gets added later.
- For prepping the **documentation** of the project (separate from the SRS and **done simultaneously** as the project goes, itâ€™s a document of why and how each function and features are used in the project and how they can be reused) we can either use Dropbox Paper, Google Docs or GitHub Wiki. (I prefer **Dropbox Paper** or **GitHub Wiki** because they are bit more code friendly than Google Docs, plus markdown is really easy to type on and format in these type of scenarios).


### Other things
- Following of a specific standard when coding, preferably a 4 space or single tab.
- Responsive to the project management system. Updating the progress as each little thing gets completed.
- Following the proper channel for issues. For example, we are going to use GitHub issues for the management and solving of issues. Raising and closing an issue is absolute necessity.
- As programming is an absolute necessity, whatever be the project is, above points will be valid.

## Development Process

The development process is of four steps.

- Brainstorming : Through conference calls or Dropbox paper, or maybe face to face when weâ€™re in college.
- SRS Preparation : This process will be fully based on Overleaf. Where each one of us will work on a different section. Overleaf supports dynamic real time changes to a same repository. So, even if we are editing the same file simultaneously, it wonâ€™t be a problem.
- Design : Weâ€™ll do the basic design using HTML or some prototyping software and take that reference when implementing in the final code.
- Development
  - Coding : Coding will completely modular. Each one will have a specific set of tasks, like UI/UX part and database part etc. Lastly we will merge the whole thing.
  - Documentation Preparation : Partially automatic documentation preparation using GitHub Wiki and some automatic documentation generator. ðŸ˜„ Basically, as much **laziness** as we can have ðŸ˜›
